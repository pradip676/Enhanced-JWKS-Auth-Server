# Enhanced-JWKS-Auth-Server
Enhanced JWKS Auth Server is a secure and extended implementation of a JSON Web Key Set (JWKS) server. This project adds AES encryption for private keys (using a key from the environment variable NOT_MY_KEY), user registration with Argon2 password hashing, authentication logging, and an optional rate limiter to protect against abuse
